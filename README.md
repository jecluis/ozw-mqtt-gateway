Wip:WD's DUMB OZW MQTT GATEWAY
===============================

Please note this is meant as the dumbest open-zwave to mqtt gateway ever
built. We do not intend to make it do things besides receiving events from
open-zwave, and publish them to an mqtt broker.

We will let whomever is listening to deal with those events.

We will, however, have to handle operations on the network, but we will at
first limit the operations we support. This may never become a full open-zwave
controller.

Also, please note this is mostly meant for the authors' benefit. Any
contribution is welcome.
